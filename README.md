# ECON487 Final Project

## Project details
- In Economics 487 (Data Science for Strateic Pricing), we were tasked with analyzing a messy wholesale purchase data set. My partner Ben and I investigated the data and used a
- double machine learning algorithm to approximate the price elasticity of two of the highest revenue-grossing products.

## How to download the Data Needed from our github:

## Neccessary libraries: 
  - plyr
  - dplyr
  - ggplot2
  - lubridate
  - rpart
  - rpart.plot
  - partykit
  - maptree
 
## How to reproduce our results
